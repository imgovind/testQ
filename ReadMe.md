##Test Project for Q nodejs Library
----
Tried out a few examples for nesting nodejs callbacks

1. Experimented with using Raw promises (deferred)
2. Also implemented by nesting promises one within another (enables multiple inputs within closure)
3. Need to try nbind method to bind a scope to the callback being denodeified.
